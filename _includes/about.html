        Hello! My name is <b>Pablo López Landeros.</b>
        I am currently an undergrad <b>Applied Mathematics</b> student @  at <b>ITAM</b> working on my thesis: <b>Modelling Basketball Games as a Markov Process</b>. 
        Born and raised in Mexico City. I am intrested in Data Visualization, Machine Learning and Statistics applied to sports analysis.
        This is reflected in my contributions at <a href="https://9plus6.com/">9plus6</a>. Which are all dedicated to data visualization and
        statistical analysis in the NBA, NFL and other major league sports.  

        In my free time, I attempt to do NBA and NFL Analytics :)
