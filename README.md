# Personal Website

This is the code I used to create my personal website (a hodge podge of HTML, CSS, and JS code). 

I initially used a template but have made many a modification, so feel free to fork mine if you like the new changes (new colors, new sections, sticky sidebar, etcetera) that I have made. You can always reach out to me by filling out the form on the bottom of amawest.github.io, too!
